# QuantumAI-IntradayRiskDemo

This project demonstrates the use of Quantum AI for intraday risk modeling, combining live data ingestion, AI predictions, and quantum optimization.

## Features

1. **Live Data Ingestion**: Fetch real-time financial data using Bloomberg API for accurate market insights.
2. **Volatility Prediction**: Leverage LSTM models to forecast intraday market volatility.
3. **Quantum Optimization**: Use quantum computing to optimize portfolio risk and sensitivities dynamically.
4. **Real-Time Portfolio Adjustments**: Integrate live data and predictions to make real-time actionable decisions.

## Setup

1. **Create a Python Environment**:

   - Use `conda` or `virtualenv` to create an isolated Python environment.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     conda create -n quantum_ai_demo python=3.8
     conda activate quantum_ai_demo
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   - Install all required libraries using `requirements.txt`:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Demo Notebook**:

   - Launch Jupyter Notebook and execute the `demo_notebook.ipynb` step by step:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```

4. **Bloomberg API Configuration**:
   - Ensure you have access to the Bloomberg Terminal and the Bloomberg Python API (`blpapi`) installed.
   - Open the terminal before running any API-related code.

## Workflow Overview

### **1. Data Ingestion**

- Use the Bloomberg API to fetch real-time market data (e.g., stock prices, volatility).

### **2. AI Model for Predictions**

- Train an LSTM model on historical price data to predict future volatility trends.

### **3. Quantum Optimization**

- Solve optimization problems, such as risk sensitivity adjustments, using a QUBO formulation and D-Waveâ€™s quantum annealer.

### **4. Integrated Workflow**

- Combine live data, AI predictions, and quantum optimization to deliver actionable insights for intraday portfolio adjustments.

## Outputs

1. **Predicted Volatility**: AI-generated forecasts for intraday market trends.
2. **Quantum Optimization Results**: Optimized portfolio adjustments for risk sensitivities.
3. **Visualizations**: Graphs showing market trends, volatility predictions, and optimization results.

## Future Enhancements

- **Multi-Asset Support**: Extend the workflow to handle multi-asset portfolios.
- **Regulatory Stress Testing**: Incorporate regulatory stress scenarios into the workflow.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Integrate outputs with dashboards like Power BI or Tableau.
